    Deleveop fundamental Computing Systems: Understand how operating systems and computer networks work, and how hardware and software interact. This knowledge give a strong theorectical foundation for practical skills.
    Focus on cultivating a systematic and analytical approach to understanding and deconstructing complex problems. I aim to thoroughly identify the underlying issues and challenges, and then design innovative algorithmic solutions that are both efficient and scalable.
    Once the solutions are conceptualized, work on translating them into functional programs, ensuring that they are well-structured, maintainable, and capable of addressing the original problems effectively. Additionally, I plan to continually test and refine your
    solutions to improve performance and adapt to changing requirements.

  <p>Become a skilled and flexible programmer: Focus on mastering key programming concepts, data structures, and algorithms, not just basic syntax. The goal is to write efficient, and scalable code in various programming languages. 
     A successful career in technology demands more than just strong technical skills; it also requires effective communication and collaboration abilities. I would like to engage actively in group projects, where I can learn to share
     ideas and work with others. Contributing to team assignments will not only help me develop my teamwork skills but also enable me to understand different perspectives and approaches to problem-solving. Additionally, I would like to
     seek out opportunities to present my work, whether in team meetings or larger forums. This will help build my confidence in my public speaking abilities and improve my capacity to convey complex information clearly and concisely.
     By focusing on these areas, I will significantly boost my professional capabilities and prepare myself for a successful journey in the tech industry.
