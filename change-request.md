### How This Change Will Affect the Constraints:

If Windy's servers are experiencing slow response times or unexpected downtime, it could lead to delays in how quickly your page loads, as well as impact the visual presentation of the content. For instance, you may notice lag in loading dynamic elements or disruptions in real-time data displays. Despite these potential issues, itâ€™s important to note that the widget itself is generally dependable and designed to function smoothly under normal circumstances. Understanding these factors can help set realistic expectations for users regarding their experience with the website.
