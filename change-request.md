## *TOOL: PROJECT CHANGE REQUEST*

### Project Name: *About Me*

### Requested By: Greg Gamel

### Prosposed Change: 

Add new feature of embedded map from Windy to customize location.

### Reason for the Change: 

Customizing the location on the interactive map, along with its detailed forecasts and various layers, encourages visitors to spend more time on the page as they explore the weather in different areas.

### How This Change Will Add Value: 

Incorporating Windy.com adds significant value by providing interactive, real-time weather data that boosts user engagement, improves the overall experience, and establishes credibility

### How This Change Will Affect the Constraints:

The website's functionality will depend on the availability and performance of Windy.com's servers. If Windy's servers are slow or experience downtime, it may affect how quickly your page loads or how it appears visually. However, the widget is generally reliable.
